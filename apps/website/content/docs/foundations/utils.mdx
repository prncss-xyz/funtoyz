# Utils

## pipe

```typescript
pipe(f, g, h, ...)(a)
```

Returns a function equivalent to left-to-right composition of the functions passed as arguments. The first argument may have any arity; the remaining arguments must be unary.

## flow

```typescript
flow(a, f, g, h, ...)
```

Taking the first argument as an initial value, applies all the remaining arguments (which are functions) from left-to-right. Use this to have a better type inference when type of `a` is known an type of functions are generic.
